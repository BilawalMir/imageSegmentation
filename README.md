# Image Segmentation using PixelLib

This project demonstrates image segmentation using the PixelLib library in Python.  It utilizes a pre-trained Mask R-CNN model to identify and segment objects within an image.

## Description

This code performs instance segmentation on an image, which means it not only identifies the different objects in the image but also creates a pixel-level mask for each individual object. This allows for a more detailed understanding of the image content.

## Dependencies

* Python 3.x
* PixelLib
* TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the PixelLib backend)
* OpenCV (often a dependency of PixelLib)

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pixellib tensorflow  # Or pip install pixellib torch if using PyTorch
```

If you encounter issues with TensorFlow installation, please refer to the official TensorFlow installation guide for your specific operating system.  PixelLib often handles OpenCV installation as a dependency, but if you have problems, you can install it separately: `pip install opencv-python`.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository (or download the code):**  If you have this code in a repository, clone it. Otherwise, save the Python script as a `.py` file (e.g., `segment.py`).

2. **Download the pre-trained model:** The code uses a Mask R-CNN model pre-trained on the COCO dataset. You need to download this model and place it in the same directory as your Python script (or provide the correct path to the model file).  The model file `mask_rcnn_coco.h5` is assumed to be in the same directory.  You can typically find this model file from the PixelLib documentation or a related model zoo.  *Make sure to download the correct model file.*

3. **Place your image:** Place the image you want to segment (e.g., `image.jpg`) in the same directory as the script.  You can change the image path in the code if needed.

4. **Run the script:**

```bash
python segment.py  # Or the name of your Python file
```

5. **View the output:** The segmented image will be saved as `output1.jpg` in the same directory.  The `show_bboxes = True` argument will also draw bounding boxes around the detected objects.

## Code Explanation

```python
import pixellib
from pixellib.instance import instance_segmentation

segment_image = instance_segmentation()
segment_image.load_model("mask_rcnn_coco.h5") # Load the pre-trained model

# Perform segmentation
segment_image.segmentImage("image.jpg", output_image_name = "output1.jpg", show_bboxes = True)
```

* **`import pixellib` and `from pixellib.instance import instance_segmentation`:** Import the necessary PixelLib modules.
* **`segment_image = instance_segmentation()`:** Create an instance of the instance segmentation class.
* **`segment_image.load_model("mask_rcnn_coco.h5")`:** Load the pre-trained Mask R-CNN model.  *Ensure this path is correct.*
* **`segment_image.segmentImage(...)`:**  Performs the segmentation.
    * `"image.jpg"`: Path to the input image.
    * `output_image_name = "output1.jpg"`: Path to save the segmented image.
    * `show_bboxes = True`:  Draws bounding boxes around the detected objects.

## Troubleshooting

* **Model not found:** Double-check the path to the `mask_rcnn_coco.h5` file. Make sure it's in the correct directory or provide the full path.
* **Installation issues:** Review the installation instructions for PixelLib and its dependencies (TensorFlow/PyTorch, OpenCV).
* **CUDA/GPU issues (if applicable):** If you're using a GPU, ensure that CUDA and cuDNN are correctly installed and configured for TensorFlow/PyTorch.
